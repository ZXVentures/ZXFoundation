 Provides outlets for mocks/testing a URLSessionDataTaskType. Intentionally
 left open and without additional logic within `resume` as it's unlikely
 that we need to test if `resume` was called but still need this shim
 to implement `MockURLSession`. 
 
 If you want to test whether `resume` was called simply override this default
 implementation and include the mock `URLSessionDataTaskType` into the initializer
 provided for `MockURLSession`.
